# Multibuilding AHU Fault Detection and Diagnosis

This is a new, standalone research repository for analysing the real
multibuilding AHU dataset from the Scientific Data publication associated with
Figshare record 27147678. It is separate from the completed RBC-ASHRAE1312
project.

The project will investigate whether machine-learning methods can detect
abnormal AHU operation, diagnose fault categories, and generalise across AHUs
and buildings. The initial building roles are provisional until the raw-data
audit is complete:

- auditorium: primary multiclass diagnosis study;
- office: primary unseen-building/generalisation study;
- hospital: data-quality and transfer case study.

## Development approach

The Python package will be the source of truth for ingestion, data-quality
decisions, feature engineering, splitting, modelling, evaluation, and saved
artefacts. Notebooks will be added later as a readable reporting layer; they
will load saved outputs rather than duplicate the implementation.

No model training is part of the initial repository setup. The first gate is a
reproducible audit of the raw files and a frozen data-quality policy.

## Setup

```bash
cd /Users/mili/Desktop/IRPN
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The source CSV files are not committed to Git. Download or place them locally
as described in [data/raw/README.md](data/raw/README.md).

## Repository status

Phase 0 is complete when provenance, checksums, project boundaries, and the
raw-data location have been recorded. See [docs/project_plan.md](docs/project_plan.md)
for the staged implementation plan.
